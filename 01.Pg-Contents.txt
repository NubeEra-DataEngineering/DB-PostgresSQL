Postgres setup for Pre-production servers with Minimum Resource Requirements (CPU / RAM etc):
	Containerization with Docker or Kubernetes for lightweight resource allocation
	Automated provisioning and configuration management using tools like Ansible or Terraform
	Fine-tuning PostgreSQL configuration parameters for optimized performance on constrained resources

Postgres setup for Production servers with best practices:
	Implementing a multi-node PostgreSQL cluster for high availability and load balancing
	Implementing security measures such as encryption, role-based access control, and auditing to protect sensitive data
	
Postgres setup for Hot and Cold Data:
	Differentiating between hot data (frequently accessed) and cold data (infrequently accessed).
	Analyzing access patterns and data usage to identify hot and cold data segments.
	Basic overview of partitioning techniques such as range, list, and hash partitioning.
	
Functions and Stored Procedures best practices:
	Implementing error handling 
	Implementing transaction management within stored procedures to ensure data integrity
	

Backup and Archival processes:
	Implementing automated backup solutions such as pgBackRest, Barman, or pg_dump for regular backups
	
Performance Optimization of Database:
	Optimizing database schema design, including normalization, denormalization, and table partitioning

High Availability and Fault Tolerance:
	Implementing data redundancy and data center failover strategies to ensure continuous operation in case of hardware or network failures
